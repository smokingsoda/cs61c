Checkoff Question 1:As each the innermost loop increments, both jki and kji can hit(due to the spatial locality and temporal locality). In other words, these algorithms can keep cache hot.
Checkoff Question 2:A can not be accessed by a reasonable stride.
Checkoff Question 3:According to the function or arithmetic expression, we shoule choose the most indepent parameters as the innermost loop number that would be incremented.
